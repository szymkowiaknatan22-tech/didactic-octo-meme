# 🚀 Quick Start: Enable GitHub Pages

## Just 3 Steps!

### Step 1: Open Settings
Go to: https://github.com/szymkowiaknatan22-tech/didactic-octo-meme/settings/pages

### Step 2: Configure Source
Under "Build and deployment":
- **Source**: Select `GitHub Actions` (from dropdown)
- ✅ That's it for settings!

### Step 3: Trigger Build
The workflow will auto-run when you:
- Push to this branch ✅ (already pushed!)
- Or merge this PR
- Or click "Actions" → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → "Run workflow"

## What Happens Next

⏱️  2-3 min  - Pygbag compiles game to WebAssembly  
✅ Complete  - Game deployed to Pages
🎮 Play!     - Visit your URL
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❓ Not deploying?
